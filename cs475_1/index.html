<h5>Running the program</h5>

<p>To compile the code unzip the submission, go to the un-zipped folder and type 
<code>sh
$ make
</code>
This should generate an executable called <code>model</code> in the folder. To run the executable type
<code>sh
$ ./model
</code></p>

<p>The models we're submitting are in the <code>models/</code> directory. To load a model, press <code>L</code> on the GLFW window and type the name of the model you want to load. The models we're submitting are</p>

<ul>
<li>mac2</li>
<li>table</li>
<li>tubelight2</li>
</ul>

<p>To load <code>mac2</code> press <code>L</code> and type <code>mac2</code> on the terminal window and press <code>Enter</code>. The program will add the directory name and extension by itself.</p>

<h5>Controls</h5>

<h6>Inspection mode:</h6>

<p>The inspection mode controls are as follows:
 - <code>I</code> activates the inspection mode.
 - <code>L</code> loads a model from the <code>models/</code> directory.
 - <code>A</code> and <code>D</code> move the currently loaded model in the + and - x-direction respectively.
 - <code>W</code> and <code>S</code> move the currently loaded model in the + and - y-direction respectively.
 - <code>Z</code> and <code>X</code> move the currently loaded model in the + and - z-direction respectively.
 - The right and left arrow keys provide rotation about the x-axis.
 - The top and bottom arrow keys provide rotation about the y-axis.
 - The Page Up and Page Down keys provide rotation about the z-axis.
 - <code>Q</code> and <code>E</code> scale the model so as to provide zoom.
 - <code>R</code> re-centers the model at its centroid.
 - <code>Tab</code> changes the currently active (displayed) model.
 - <code>V</code> toggles pesudo-lighting.
 - <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> increase/decrease the lighting intensity.</p>

<h6>Modeling mode:</h6>

<p>In addition to the controls in the inspection mode, we have the following controls in the modeling mode:
 - <code>M</code> activates the modeling mode.
 - Clicking adds a new point at the point you click on and the active z-coordinate.
 - Scrolling adjusts the active z-coordinate so that we're able to draw in 3D.
 - Shift + clicking removes the last added point.
 - <code>C</code> followed by the R, G, B and A values in the terminal sets the drawing color. </p>
